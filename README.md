_**Ideas are these disembodied life forms, they don't have a form, but they have a will. All they want is to be made manifest. If you can manage to open up your consciousness to an idea of living in a world of abundance, then you can believe that, constantly, ideas are trying to find human collaborators.**_

Elizabeth Gilbert
